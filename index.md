Though civil rights literary icon James Baldwin did not live to see the internet age, today his words, voice, and visage are recirculated far and wide across it. This website features a series of exploratory data visualizations about Baldwin's digital recirculation and reception --- with a particular focus on Baldwin's role within the #BlackLivesMatter movement in 2014-2015.

These two tweets from activist Deray McKesson feature illustrations (by John Ira Jennings and Ronald Wimberly, respectively) of two slightly different Baldwin quotations that were recirculated widely in #BlackLivesMatter-related tweets throughout 2014-2015. These illustrations eloquently demonstrate the divergent interpretations and reimaginations of Baldwin that are represented within these datasets.
