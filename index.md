Though civil rights literary icon **James Baldwin**, who died in 1987, did not live to see the internet age, today his words, voice, and visage are recirculated far and wide across it. This website features a series of [data visualizations](BlackLivesMatter-Baldwin) about Baldwin's 21st-century, digital reception that are designed to be explored by students, fans, and scholars.

The two illustrations pictured above, which were designed by John Ira Jennings and Ronald Wimberly, respectively, and which were both tweeted by activist [Deray McKesson](https://twitter.com/deray), feature two slightly different Baldwin quotations that were popular in 2014-15.

These two facing figures---**at right**, a contemplative, blue, comic-bookish Baldwin, with the words "Negro," "relatively," and "almost all the time"; **at left**, a street-art red Baldwin, with a bouquet of Black Power-style fists bursting from his mind, and the words "black," "to live," and "constant state of rage !"---represent the powerful and divergent reimaginations of Baldwin that are captured on this website. These data visualizations, publications, and resources are intented to help students, fans, and scholars learn more about Baldwin through his many digital afterlives and to help them answer questions such as:

* Which *parts* of Baldwin's life and career are people tweeting about or turning into memes?
* Which *texts* from Baldiwn's prolific output are people quoting from or checking out from the library?
* Which *videos* are people watching and sharing on YouTube?
* Which of the above *isn't getting very much attention at all*?
* **Why, above all, does James Baldwin matter to so many people today**?

**This website is still growing and currently under construction. Stay tuned!**
